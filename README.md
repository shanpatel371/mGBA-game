In this 2D interactive game designed to run on mGBA (Game Boy Advance Emulator), your goal is to maneuver a goalpost using button controls to catch yellow squares. Let's delve into the game's mechanics and features.

### Game Description:
Your objective is straightforward: control the movement of a goalpost to intercept three yellow squares before they pass a certain threshold. The game utilizes basic 2D button key movements to navigate the goalpost across the screen. The challenge lies in timing and precision as you attempt to intercept the squares while avoiding letting any slip past into the red zone.

### Game Functionality:
The game leverages the capabilities of mGBA, primarily focusing on creating graphics tailored to the Game Boy Advance platform. Graphics rendering is achieved by manipulating the video buffer to draw pixels on the screen. One of the key technical challenges overcome during development was preventing tearing, a visual artifact caused by simultaneous updates to the video buffer while it's in the process of rendering.

### Gameplay Mechanics:
- **Movement Controls:** Players use directional buttons to move the goalpost horizontally and vertically.
- **Interception Challenge:** Three yellow squares must be intercepted by the goalpost before they cross into the red zone.
- **Win Condition:** Successfully intercepting all three squares leads to victory, triggering the win screen.
- **Loss Condition:** Failing to intercept a square before it enters the red zone results in a loss, ending the game.
